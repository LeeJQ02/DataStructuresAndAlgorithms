# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM PROGRAM 
version 1.0 (30/6/2022)

Only program developer and administration are allow to view module's README file.

The code that contains BST Tree and Dijkstra algorithm program

There are total 3 file in the program
Files:
1. Dijsktra - File that contains all the functions of a Dijsktra Algorithm (insert node, calculate shortest path from selected source node, compare adjacent node, print result).
	Note: It allows user to input from 5 nodes to 10 nodes to  calculate the shortest path. It will calculate and print the results of the shortest path.
2. BinarySearchTree - File that contains functions of a Binary SearchTree (insert node, search node, delete/replace node, print result).
	Note: It allows user to input how many node that they wish to input, followed by a key and a name of the node. It allow the user to choose which Traversal results to be printed (Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder).
3. Main- Code file to run the program .
	Note: an object from class Dijsktra and BinarySearchTree are created -> Dijkstra D = new Dijkstra(), BinarySearchTree BST = new BinarySearchTree().

Software requirement to run the program:
1. Java IDE or online Java complier
2. Latest Java JDK version

Instructions to run the program:
1. Import all codes into a Java IDE or online Java complier
2. Run Main(Main class)
3. Enter your selection
4. Follow the guides in the program console
